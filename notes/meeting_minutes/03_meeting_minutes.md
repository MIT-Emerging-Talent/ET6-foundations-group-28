### Key discussions

_How to fix the linting errors?_  
• **INIT PY FILE**  
Add an init py file  (**init**.py) in YOUR branch of _solutions_ file, also in
_test_ file before push into github.

### Decision made  

**Action Items**  
  _What needs to be done?_  
[ ] Every branch you work on from now on should include and empty file named
(**init**..py)  

### Follow up

Merge files into the main branch and observe if any errors occur.  
Some files will be added on the main branch so when merging it will be checked.

### Other notes

We fixed two linting errors, the other two will be discussed on the next meeting.

### Next meeting

Will be discussed on Slack  
12 EST “appropriate for everyone”  
On Ghyath terms :))
