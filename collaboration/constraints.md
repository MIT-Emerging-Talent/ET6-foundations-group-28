# Constraints

Project constraints establish the boundaries, limitations, and requirements within
which a project must operate. They serve as a framework to guide decisions, align
team efforts, and ensure the project remains on track.

## External Constraints

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->
- ### Project Deadline
  
  Project Must be Completed by 10 Jan 2025.

- ### Project Minimum Requirements
  
  Each team member must solve two coding challenges and review two
  challenges completed by other members.

- ### Response Time
  
  - Indicates how quickly the team responds to project tasks, considering
    personal circumstances such as work, school, and other MIT assignments.
  - Average team _Response Time_ is six hours. This necessitates an
    asynchronous workflow.

- ### Technical Issues

  - Includes issues like internet connectivity, device malfunctions, etc.
  - Some members experience technical issues, reinforcing the need for an
    asynchronous collaboration approach.

## Internal Constraints: Involuntary

- ### Programming Experience

   The team consists of mostly beginner to intermediate programmers, so challenges
   will primarily focus on easy to medium difficulty levels.

- ### Collaboration Experience

  The team has limited experience in remote collaboration, which restricts the
  number of challenges that can be effectively addressed.

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal Constraints: Voluntary

- Each team member can solve a maximum of five challenges.
- Deadline to meet the minimum requirement is 7 Jan 2025.
<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
