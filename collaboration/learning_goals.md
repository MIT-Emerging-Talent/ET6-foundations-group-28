## üí° **Why Focus on TDD?**

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a valuable methodology that helps:

- Ensure **code quality** by writing tests before implementation.
- Build **robust, bug-free solutions**.
- Encourage **clean and maintainable code**.
- Improve **developer productivity** by reducing time spent on debugging.

As a team, we believe adopting TDD will enhance our problem-solving capabilities
and improve our overall coding practices.

Let's work together to grow as a team, improve our programming skills, and deliver
high-quality, well-tested solutions! üéâ
