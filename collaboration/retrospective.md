# Retrospective

**Deadline**
_Finished all assigned tasks (challenges) on the 10th Jan_  
_Finished retrospective (documentation) on the 11th Jan_

## Stop Doing

_Mistakes, missed steps, or things that could have been better._

+ **Misuse of the Project Board:**  
  
  At the start, the project board wasn't utilized effectively with all its
  functionalities to organize the workflow. Instead, to track progress
  and individual contributions and challenges, a less efficient method was used in
  [discussions](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-foundations-group-28/discussions/69).

+ **Merging Branches with Failed CI Checks:**

  Only 3 challenges were merged without passing all CI Checks. The checks were
  fixed in the main branch after merging, but the pull requests still display failing
  CI checks.

+ **Time Management Could Have Been Better:**

  Delays in response time led to slower progress on interdependent tasks. We had
  to extend the deadline of the minimum requirements as a result.

+ **Wrong Branch Naming:**  

  There were few instances where branches were named after individuals.

+ Leaving Python pull request template in markdown pull requests description,
  which caused some confusion.

## Continue Doing

_What went well that we should continue doing in the next project._

+ **Effective Meetings**  
Well-planned and also with a clear meeting agendas; leading to
productive discussions
  + **Meeting Minutes**: very effective - particularly for
  our asynchronous workflow.
+ **Group Collaboration**  
The crew contributed equally, shared knowledge effectively,
 and respected diverse opinions.
+ **Decision Making**
  + Through healthy conversations in communication channels:
   Meetings, Pull Request, Discussions, Issues, Slack and WhatsApp.
  + Based on the majority rule through polls when there was a difference of opinion.
+ Implementing the branch protection rule to protect the main branch from the
start helped with the workflow significantly.

## Start Doing

_Any good ideas to try out in the next project._

+ **Solution Review**  
Solutions can be reviewed by **more than one reviewer**; but merged by one;
_to gain more insight from each other and have a better understanding of codes._
+ **Conventions**  
Establish clear conventions at an early stage: Branch Naming, Issue Naming  
Pull Request Titles, Commits Messages, Coding Style, etc.

+ Branches can be linked to the issue they are addressing for better organization.

+ Delete Branches after merging.
+ Add adequate description in pull requests.
+ Include synchronous code review in a video call meeting, whenever possible.
+ **Group Support**  
More support for the rest of the group, by following up with the progress of
each member and reaching out as a group.

## Lessons Learned

_what cool things or general lessons has your team learned?_

+ **Safety Factor in planning**  

  Include a buffer in our schedule to manage unforeseen delays, and have
a backup plan to tackle unexpected challenges effectively.  
Major effect: In deadlines, CI checks, unexpected challenge difficulties.
+ **Skills Gained:**
  + Effective collaboration
  + A good grasp of asynchronous workflow and remote collaboration.
+ **Github usage**  

  Gained expertise in using GitHub efficiently, leveraging its features for
  better coordination, collaboration and professionalism.
+ **Managed human resources effectively as a group.**
