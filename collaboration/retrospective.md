**Deadline**  
_Finished all assigned tasks (challenges) on the 10th Jan_  
_Finished retrospective (documentation) on the 11th Jan_

## Stop Doing

_what mistakes did we make? did we miss a step? could our
communication have been better?_
+ **Delaying Deadline:**  
We had to extend the deadline of the minimum requirements
+ **Effective Usage of the Project Board:**  
  At first: Tracking individual contributions and challenges,
  instead used [Discussions](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-foundations-group-28/discussions/69)
+ **Old CI Checks:**  
Only 3 challenges : Merged without passing all CI Checks  
_Didn't require additional fixes post-merge_  
When merged to main, It remained. Now part of the repo, its ok
+ **Communication: Time Mangement**    
Delays in response time led to slower progress on
interdependent tasks.
+ **Naming branches Coventions**  
Named after individuals (only two by mistake and were deleted) 
+ **Leaving Pull request templates and pull request for things 
than challenges**

## Continue Doing

_what went well that we should continue doing in the next project?_
+ **Effective Meetings**  
Well-planned and also with a clear meeting agenda; leading to
productive discussions
  + **Meeting Minutes**: very effective - particularly for
  our asynchronous workflow
+ **Group Collaboration**  
The crew contributed equally, shared knowledge effectively,
 and respected diverse opinions.
+ **Decision Making**  
Based on the majority rule: Polls on Discussions: Meetings,
Pull Request or Issues
+ **Github usage**  
Adopting the branch protection rule at the start and also
learned Github the professional way :)


## Start Doing

_any good ideas we'd like to try out in the next project?_
+ **Solution Review**  
Each solution can be reviewed by more than one; but merged by one.
+ **Conventions**  
Discussed at an early stage:  
Branch naming, Issue naming,
pull request title, messages and commits; challenge
 format when issued.
+ **Organizing files**  
 Every time you make a branch can be linked to an issue. 
+ **Group Support**  
More support for the rest of the group, checking progress
 of each member and reaching out as a group
+ **Delete Branches after merge**
+ **Add adequate description in pull requests**
+ **Include Synchronous code review meeting in a video call,
 whenever possible.**

## Lessons Learned

_what cool things or general lessons has your team learned?_
+ **Safety Factor in planning**  
Include a buffer in our schedule to manage unforeseen delays;  
and ensure you have a backup plan to tackle unexpected challenges effectively
Major effect : in deadline, ci checks, challenge
+ **Skills Gained:**
  + Effective collaboration
  + Managing time at the very start
  + A good grasp of asynchronous work and remote collaboration
+ **Github usage**  
Gained expertise in using GitHub efficiently,
 leveraging its features for better coordination and professionalism
+ **Managed human resources effectively as a group**

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
