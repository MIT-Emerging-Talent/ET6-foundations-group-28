# Retrospective

> "In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity."  
> _Sun Tzu, The Art of War_

## Deadline  

+ _Finished minimum requirements (two challenges) on the 10th Jan_.
+ _Finished retrospective (documentation) on the 11th Jan_.

## Stop Doing

_Mistakes, missed steps, or things that could have been better._

+ **Misuse of the Project Board:**  
  
  At the start, the project board wasn't utilized effectively with all its
  functionalities to organize the workflow. Instead, to track progress
  and individual contributions and challenges, a less efficient method was used in
  [discussions](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-foundations-group-28/discussions/69).

+ **Merging Branches with Failed CI Checks:**

  Three challenges were merged without passing all CI checks at the start of the
  project. The checks were fixed in the main branch after merging, but the pull
  requests still display failing CI checks as part of the commits history, which
  is an immutable metadata of the merged pull request.

+ **Time Management Could Have Been Better:**

  Delays in response time led to slower progress on interdependent tasks. As a result
  of that, we had to extend the deadline of the minimum requirements.

+ **Wrong Branch Naming:**  

  There were few instances where branches were named after individuals.

+ Leaving Python pull request template in markdown pull requests description,
  which caused some confusion.

## Continue Doing

_What went well that we should continue doing in the next project._

+ **Effective Meetings**  
Well-planned and also with a clear meeting agendas; leading to
productive discussions
  + **Meeting Minutes**: very effective - particularly for
  our asynchronous workflow.
+ **Group Collaboration**  
The crew contributed equally, shared knowledge effectively,
 and respected diverse opinions.
+ **Decision Making**
  + Through healthy conversations in communication channels:
   Meetings, Pull Request, Discussions, Issues, Slack and WhatsApp.
  + Based on the majority rule through polls when there was a difference of opinion.
+ Implementing the branch protection rule to protect the main branch from the
start helped with the workflow significantly.

## Start Doing

_Any good ideas to try out in the next project._

+ **Solution Review**  
Solutions can be reviewed by **more than one reviewer**; but merged by one;
_to gain more insight from each other and have a better understanding of codes._
+ **Conventions**  
  Establish clear conventions at an early stage: Branch Naming, Issue Naming,
  Pull Request Titles, Commits Messages, Coding Style, etc.
+ Delete Branches after merging.
+ Add adequate description in pull requests.
+ Include synchronous code review in a video call meeting, whenever possible.
+ **Group Support**  
More support for the rest of the group, by following up with the progress of
each member and reaching out as a group.

## Lessons Learned

_what cool things or general lessons has your team learned?_

+ **Safety Factor in planning**  

  Include a buffer in our schedule to manage unforeseen delays, and have
a backup plan to tackle unexpected challenges effectively.  
Major effect: In deadlines, CI checks, unexpected challenge difficulties.
+ **Skills Gained:**
  + Effective collaboration
  + A good grasp of asynchronous workflow and remote collaboration.
+ **Github usage**  

  + Gained expertise in using GitHub efficiently, leveraging its features for
   better coordination, collaboration and professionalism.
  + Pull requests are associated with immutable metadata that cannot be changed.
+ Learned an edge case in Python doctest where the test fails in functions that
  return multiline strings with newline characters.
+ Effective human resources management as a group.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

+ Completed the expected number of challenges.
+ Use of labels on Issues and PRs organized things well as expected.
+ Communication went as planned.
+ Collaboration went as planned.
+ Individual and group goals were achieved to a high degree.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

+ Use of conventions wasn't implemented as expected.
+ CI Checks took a lot of time to be solved.
+ Project Board Workflow: at the start wasn't utilized efficiently.
+ Time Management Expectations: Missed the initial voluntary deadline.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

+ Solving CI checks issues by adding init.py files and installing ruff formatter.
+ Extension of the minimum requirements voluntary deadline.

### Or remove extra steps?

+ Removed pull requests from the project board.
+ Challenge Register Tables in discussions: Not needed.
